# Technova Hackathon Resources

- AI (Small Language Models) that are small enough to run on a laptop/mobile phone you can run offline: [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core)
- A framework to build modern, full-stack web applications: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)
- Setup a local database for development: [Supabase](https://www.mywebnotes.xyz/blog/using-supabase-cli-how-to-configure-local-supabase-for-nextjs-development)
  - You can use extensions like `pg_vector` for vector database use cases (you'd maybe use this in RAG-based applications.)
- Use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for running AI models on your laptop. Here's an example: [Run Gemma with Ollama](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/integrations/ollama)
- Use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com), a Python web framework that you can use to build AI/ML backend apps.


AI Tools that you can use to build your projects:
- [Cursor](https://cursor.ai): AI powered IDE. Ideal for projects that have diverse technologies. (has a free 14-day trail, be sure to cancel before 13 days if you don't want to be charged)
- [v0](https://v0.dev): Web-based web app/website generator that uses Next.js
